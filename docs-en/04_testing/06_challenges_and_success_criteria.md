## Mitigation Strategies in Detail

### Creating a Robust FFmpeg Abstraction

FFmpeg is a critical dependency for edv. To mitigate challenges:

1. **Abstraction Layer**:
   - Create a clear interface for all FFmpeg operations
   - Hide version-specific details behind the abstraction
   - Implement adapters for different FFmpeg versions

2. **Mock Implementation**:
   - Develop a mock FFmpeg implementation for testing
   - Simulate common operations without requiring FFmpeg
   - Record and play back FFmpeg interactions

3. **Version Detection**:
   - Implement robust FFmpeg version detection
   - Adjust commands based on available features
   - Skip tests that require unavailable features

### Handling Platform-Specific Behavior

To address platform-specific challenges:

1. **Cross-Platform Testing Matrix**:
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Validate on different hardware configurations
   - Document platform-specific limitations

2. **Platform-Specific Code Paths**:
   - Identify operations that need platform-specific handling
   - Implement conditional code for different platforms
   - Test each platform-specific code path

3. **Common Abstraction**:
   - Create platform-independent abstractions
   - Hide platform details behind interfaces
   - Test the interfaces rather than implementations

### Managing Large Test Files

For efficient handling of large video files in testing:

1. **Efficient Test Assets**:
   - Create small, representative test files
   - Generate synthetic test content when possible
   - Compress test assets for storage

2. **On-Demand Test Data**:
   - Download test assets only when needed
   - Cache downloaded assets across test runs
   - Clean up assets after tests complete

3. **Asset Metadata**:
   - Store metadata about test assets
   - Select appropriate assets based on test requirements
   - Use asset characteristics rather than specific files

### Addressing Performance Variations

To handle performance variations:

1. **Statistical Approach**:
   - Use statistical methods for performance validation
   - Establish performance ranges rather than exact values
   - Run multiple iterations to account for variance

2. **Relative Comparison**:
   - Compare relative performance between versions
   - Focus on regression detection
   - Use normalized metrics for comparisons

3. **Controlled Environments**:
   - Use dedicated performance testing environments
   - Control system load during benchmarks
   - Document hardware specifications for benchmarks
