# edv - Testing Tools and Automation

This document outlines the testing tools, frameworks, and automation approaches used in the edv project to ensure consistent, reliable testing.

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Rust Testing Tools

The edv project leverages Rust's built-in testing capabilities along with several specialized testing tools:

- **Built-in Test Framework**: 
  - Use Rust's built-in `#[test]` attribute for unit and integration tests
  - Utilize test organization features like `#[cfg(test)]` modules
  - Employ standard assertion macros (`assert!`, `assert_eq!`, etc.)

- **Test Runners**: 
  - Use `cargo test` for running unit and integration tests
  - Employ `cargo test -- --nocapture` for debugging test output
  - Use test filters to run specific tests or test groups

- **Mocking**: 
  - Use `mockall` for creating mock objects
  - Create mock implementations of external dependencies
  - Use mock expectations to verify interaction patterns

- **Assertions**: 
  - Use standard Rust assertions for basic checks
  - Employ custom assertion macros for domain-specific validations
  - Implement helper functions for common assertion patterns

- **Code Coverage**: 
  - Use `tarpaulin` for measuring code coverage on Linux
  - Employ `grcov` for coverage on all platforms
  - Set coverage targets and track progress

### Performance Testing Tools

For performance testing, the edv project uses specialized benchmarking and profiling tools:

- **Benchmarking**: 
  - Use `criterion` for reliable, statistical benchmarking
  - Create benchmark groups for related operations
  - Implement parametric benchmarks for testing scaling characteristics

- **Profiling**: 
  - Use `flamegraph` for CPU profiling and hot spot identification
  - Employ `perf` on Linux for low-level performance analysis
  - Use sampling profilers to identify performance bottlenecks

- **Memory Analysis**: 
  - Use `valgrind` and `DHAT` for memory profiling on Linux
  - Employ custom memory tracking for allocation patterns
  - Implement memory usage metrics and tracking

- **Continuous Monitoring**: 
  - Track performance metrics across builds in CI
  - Implement regression detection for performance changes
  - Create performance dashboards for trend analysis

### Test Data Management

Effective management of test data is crucial for reliable testing:

- **Test Fixtures**: 
  - Maintain a collection of test video files with known characteristics
  - Store fixtures in a version-controlled location
  - Include metadata about fixtures for targeted selection

- **Generated Content**: 
  - Create synthetic video content for specific test cases
  - Generate standardized test files with controlled properties
  - Use deterministically generated content for reproducible tests

- **Reference Outputs**: 
  - Store reference outputs for comparison
  - Use checksums or other validation mechanisms
  - Include reference outputs in version control

- **Large File Testing**: 
  - Include a subset of larger files for stress testing
  - Store large files outside of version control
  - Implement automated download of test assets when needed

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration

The test automation strategy integrates with CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous validation:

- **PR Validation**: 
  - Run unit and fast integration tests for every PR
  - Execute linting and style checks
  - Generate and publish test reports

- **Nightly Builds**: 
  - Run the full test suite including performance tests
  - Generate comprehensive coverage reports
  - Execute system tests across platforms

- **Cross-Platform Testing**: 
  - Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - Validate on different CPU architectures
  - Test with different FFmpeg versions

- **Results Reporting**: 
  - Generate test reports and trend analysis
  - Track coverage over time
  - Monitor performance metrics across builds

### CI Configuration

The following GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates how the CI is configured:

```yaml
name: Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        rust: [stable]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Install FFmpeg
      uses: FedericoCarboni/setup-ffmpeg@v2
      
    - name: Setup Rust
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        profile: minimal
        toolchain: ${{ matrix.rust }}
        override: true
        components: rustfmt, clippy
        
    - name: Check formatting
      uses: actions-rs/cargo@v1
      with:
        command: fmt
        args: --all -- --check
        
    - name: Clippy
