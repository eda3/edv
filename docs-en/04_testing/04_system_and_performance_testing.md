# edv - System and Performance Testing

This document outlines the approach to system testing and performance testing for the edv project, focusing on validating the application as a whole and ensuring efficient operation.

## System Testing

System tests validate the entire application from end to end, simulating real-world usage scenarios.

### System Testing Overview

- **Scope**: Entire application, validating complete workflows
- **Environment**: Test across all target operating systems
- **Automation**: Run as part of CI/CD pipeline, but less frequently than unit/integration tests
- **Coverage**: Test major user workflows that represent actual use cases
- **Status**: Currently planned with initial implementation starting in Q3 2024

### Key System Testing Areas

#### 1. Installation and Setup

These tests validate the installation and initial setup process:

- **FFmpeg Detection and Compatibility**:
  - Test automatic detection of FFmpeg installations
  - Validate compatibility checks for different FFmpeg versions
  - Test handling of missing or incompatible FFmpeg

- **Configuration Creation and Loading**:
  - Test default configuration generation
  - Validate loading configuration from files
  - Test environment variable overrides

- **First-Run Experience**:
  - Test application behavior on first run
  - Validate setup workflows
  - Test directory creation and permissions

#### 2. End-to-End Workflows

These tests validate complete user workflows:

- **Basic Editing Operations**:
  - Test complete trim, cut, and concat workflows
  - Validate filter application from command line to output
  - Test format conversion workflows

- **Project-Based Workflows**:
  - Test creating, modifying, and rendering projects
  - Validate timeline editing workflows
  - Test project import/export processes

- **Output Validation**:
  - Verify output file correctness across formats
  - Test with various input and output combinations
  - Validate metadata preservation

#### 3. Error Recovery and Edge Cases

These tests focus on error handling and recovery:

- **Invalid Input Handling**:
  - Test application behavior with corrupt input files
  - Validate error reporting for invalid parameters
  - Test handling of unsupported formats

- **Crash Recovery**:
  - Test recovery from unexpected termination
  - Validate project backup and restoration
  - Test handling of partial outputs

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Test behavior under low memory conditions
  - Validate handling of disk space exhaustion
  - Test operation with limited CPU resources

### Planned System Testing Implementation

The following represents the planned implementation approach for system testing, which will be developed in the upcoming quarters:

```rust
// Planned implementation in tests/system/workflow_tests.rs
#[test]
fn test_complete_edit_workflow() {
    // Prepare a clean test environment
    let temp_dir = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let input_path = copy_fixture_to_temp("test_fixtures/source.mp4", &temp_dir);
    let output_path = temp_dir.path().join("output.mp4");
    
    // Step 1: Trim the video
    let trim_output = temp_dir.path().join("trimmed.mp4");
    Command::new(get_edv_executable())
        .args(&["trim", 
                "--input", input_path.to_str().unwrap(),
                "--output", trim_output.to_str().unwrap(),
                "--start", "00:00:01.0",
                "--end", "00:00:05.0"])
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute trim command");
    
    assert!(trim_output.exists());
    
    // Step 2: Apply a filter
    let filter_output = temp_dir.path().join("filtered.mp4");
    Command::new(get_edv_executable())
        .args(&["filter", 
                "--input", trim_output.to_str().unwrap(),
                "--output", filter_output.to_str().unwrap(),
                "--filter", "eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2"])
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute filter command");
    
    assert!(filter_output.exists());
    
    // Step 3: Verify the final output using FFmpeg
    let probe_output = Command::new("ffprobe")
        .args(&["-v", "error", 
                "-show_entries", "format=duration",
                "-of", "default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1",
                filter_output.to_str().unwrap()])
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute ffprobe command");
    
    let duration_str = String::from_utf8_lossy(&probe_output.stdout);
    let duration: f64 = duration_str.trim().parse().unwrap();
    
    // Verify duration is approximately 4 seconds (5s - 1s)
    assert!((duration - 4.0).abs() < 0.1);
}
```

## Performance Testing

Performance tests measure and verify the efficiency of operations, ensuring the application meets performance expectations.

### Performance Testing Overview

use edv::core::config::AppConfig;
use edv::processing::pipeline::ProcessingPipeline;
use edv::processing::operations::trim::TrimOperation;
use std::path::Path;

fn trim_operation_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let config = AppConfig::load_default().unwrap();
    let pipeline = ProcessingPipeline::new(config.clone()).unwrap();
    
    // Prepare benchmark with different video durations
    let durations = [10, 30, 60, 120]; // seconds
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("Trim Operation");
    
    for duration in durations.iter() {
        // Use a specific test file for each duration
        let input_path = Path::new(&format!("bench_fixtures/video_{}_seconds.mp4", duration));
        
        group.bench_with_input(
            BenchmarkId::from_parameter(duration), 
            duration, 
            |b, &duration| {
                b.iter(|| {
                    let output_path = tempfile::NamedTempFile::new().unwrap();
                    let trim_op = TrimOperation::new(
                        input_path,
                        output_path.path(),
                        Some(TimePosition::from_seconds(0.0)),
                        Some(TimePosition::from_seconds(duration as f64 * 0.5)), // Trim half the video
                        true,
                    );
                    
                    pipeline.execute(Box::new(trim_op), None).unwrap();
                })
            }
        );
    }
    
    group.finish();
}

// Memory usage benchmark
fn memory_usage_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let config = AppConfig::load_default().unwrap();
    let pipeline = ProcessingPipeline::new(config.clone()).unwrap();
    
    // Prepare benchmark with different video resolutions
    let resolutions = ["480p", "720p", "1080p", "4K"];
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("Memory Usage");
    
    for resolution in resolutions.iter() {
        let input_path = Path::new(&format!("bench_fixtures/video_{}.mp4", resolution));
        
        group.bench_with_input(
            BenchmarkId::from_parameter(resolution),
            resolution,
            |b, _| {
                b.iter(|| {
                    // Use a memory profiler to track allocations
                    let _guard = memory_profiler::start_memory_profiling();
                    
                    let output_path = tempfile::NamedTempFile::new().unwrap();
                    let filter_op = FilterOperation::new(
                        input_path,
                        output_path.path(),
                        "scale=iw/2:ih/2", // Downscale by 50%
                    );
                    
                    pipeline.execute(Box::new(filter_op), None).unwrap();
                })
            }
        );
    }
    
    group.finish();
}

criterion_group!(
    benches, 
    trim_operation_benchmark,

criterion_main!(benches);
```

## Best Practices for System and Performance Testing

1. **Automation**: Automate as much as possible, but recognize that some system tests may require manual validation
2. **Real-World Scenarios**: Design tests that mimic actual user workflows
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on all supported operating systems
4. **Resource Variation**: Test with different hardware resources
5. **Benchmarking Consistency**: Use controlled environments for performance benchmarks
6. **Trend Analysis**: Track performance metrics over time to identify regressions
7. **Stress Testing**: Include tests that push the system beyond normal operating conditions
8. **Documentation**: Document performance characteristics and system requirements
