# edv - Testing Philosophy

This document outlines the foundational testing philosophy that guides the testing approach for the edv project.

## Core Principles

The edv project adopts the following testing philosophy:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: 
   - Write tests before implementing features when practical
   - Use tests to guide the design of interfaces and components
   - Ensure that every feature is testable by design

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
   - Aim for high test coverage across all modules (>80% target)
   - Prioritize testing of critical paths and error handling
   - Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive test suites

3. **Realistic Scenarios**: 
   - Test with real-world video files and scenarios
   - Create test fixtures that represent actual user workflows
   - Validate behavior with a variety of media formats and edge cases

4. **Automated Testing**: 
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD for continuous validation
   - Automate regression testing to prevent regressions
   - Ensure tests run quickly enough to be part of daily workflow

5. **Multi-level Approach**: 
   - Include unit, integration, and system-level tests
   - Balance testing pyramid with appropriate test distribution
   - Ensure each level of testing provides unique value

## Testing Mindset

When developing tests for edv, maintainers should adopt the following mindset:

- **User-Centric**: Consider how users will interact with the feature
- **Adversarial**: Try to break the code, not just confirm it works in ideal scenarios
- **Comprehensive**: Cover both happy paths and exceptional flows
- **Future-Proof**: Consider how tests will adapt to future changes
- **Maintainable**: Write tests that are clear, concise, and easy to maintain

## Test Quality Metrics

The quality of tests themselves will be measured against these criteria:

- **Reliability**: Tests should produce consistent results
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on or affect other tests
- **Speed**: Tests should execute quickly to facilitate rapid feedback
- **Clarity**: Tests should clearly express their intent and expected outcomes
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify

By adhering to these testing principles, the edv project will maintain high software quality while enabling rapid development and confident refactoring.
