# edv - Testing Philosophy

This document outlines the foundational testing philosophy that guides the testing approach for the edv project.

## Core Principles

The edv project adopts the following testing philosophy:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: 
   - Write tests before implementing features when practical
   - Use tests to guide the design of interfaces and components
   - Ensure that every feature is testable by design

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
   - Aim for high test coverage across all modules (>80% target)
   - Prioritize testing of critical paths and error handling
   - Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive test suites

3. **Realistic Scenarios**: 
   - Test with real-world video files and scenarios
   - Create test fixtures that represent actual user workflows
   - Validate behavior with a variety of media formats and edge cases

4. **Automated Testing**: 
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD for continuous validation
   - Automate regression testing to prevent regressions
   - Ensure tests run quickly enough to be part of daily workflow

5. **Multi-level Approach**: 
   - Include unit, integration, and system-level tests
   - Balance testing pyramid with appropriate test distribution
   - Ensure each level of testing provides unique value

## Testing Mindset

When developing tests for edv, maintainers should adopt the following mindset:

- **User-Centric**: Consider how users will interact with the feature
- **Adversarial**: Try to break the code, not just confirm it works in ideal scenarios
- **Comprehensive**: Cover both happy paths and exceptional flows
- **Future-Proof**: Consider how tests will adapt to future changes
- **Maintainable**: Write tests that are clear, concise, and easy to maintain

## Test Quality Metrics

The quality of tests themselves will be measured against these criteria:

- **Reliability**: Tests should produce consistent results
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on or affect other tests
- **Speed**: Tests should execute quickly to facilitate rapid feedback
- **Clarity**: Tests should clearly express their intent and expected outcomes
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify

By adhering to these testing principles, the edv project will maintain high software quality while enabling rapid development and confident refactoring. 

## Implementation Status Update (2024)

As of March 2024, the edv project has made progress in implementing its testing philosophy with varying levels of coverage across modules:

### Current Testing Status

| Aspect | Status | Implementation Level | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Unit Testing | âœ… Complete | 70% | Core functionality has unit tests, expanding coverage ongoing |
| Integration Testing | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 40% | Basic module interactions tested, more comprehensive tests needed |
| System Testing | ðŸ”¶ Planned | 20% | Initial setup, more comprehensive workflows needed |
| Performance Testing | ðŸ”¶ Planned | 10% | Basic benchmarks designed, implementation pending |
| Test Automation | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 50% | Basic test runs in place, CI pipeline enhancement ongoing |

### Key Achievements

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Good unit test coverage for completed utility modules (time, etc.)
   - Strong testing for CLI argument parsing and commands
   - Effective tests for FFmpeg detection and version handling

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Successfully employed TDD for components like time handling utilities
   - Used tests to guide API design for improved usability
   - Implemented error case testing for core functionality

3. **Structured Testing**
   - Co-located unit tests with implementation code
   - Implemented clear test naming conventions
   - Good separation of test concerns

### Focus Areas for Improvement

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Need to establish a dedicated `tests/` directory
   - Implement comprehensive module interaction tests
   - Create more test fixtures for media operations

2. **Complex Component Testing**
   - FFmpeg command generation and execution
   - Subtitle parsing and rendering
   - Audio processing operations

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Establish performance benchmarks
   - Implement memory usage tracking
   - Create tests for large file handling

### Upcoming Testing Initiatives

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Create dedicated test fixtures directory
   - Implement test helpers for common test operations
   - Establish CI workflow for continuous testing

2. **Testing Tools**
   - Introduce code coverage tracking
   - Implement test organization and discovery
   - Enhance test reporting

3. **Documentation**
   - Create testing guides for contributors
   - Document test patterns and best practices
   - Establish test naming conventions and organization

The edv project is committed to improving its testing approach, with ongoing efforts to enhance test coverage and quality across all modules.
