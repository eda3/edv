# edv - Testing Philosophy

This document outlines the foundational testing philosophy that guides the testing approach for the edv project.

## Core Principles

The edv project adopts the following testing philosophy:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: 
   - Write tests before implementing features when practical
   - Use tests to guide the design of interfaces and components
   - Ensure that every feature is testable by design

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
   - Aim for high test coverage across all modules (>80% target)
   - Prioritize testing of critical paths and error handling
   - Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive test suites

3. **Realistic Scenarios**: 
   - Test with real-world video files and scenarios
   - Create test fixtures that represent actual user workflows
   - Validate behavior with a variety of media formats and edge cases

4. **Automated Testing**: 
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD for continuous validation
   - Automate regression testing to prevent regressions
   - Ensure tests run quickly enough to be part of daily workflow

5. **Multi-level Approach**: 
   - Include unit, integration, and system-level tests
   - Balance testing pyramid with appropriate test distribution
   - Ensure each level of testing provides unique value

## Testing Mindset

When developing tests for edv, maintainers should adopt the following mindset:

- **User-Centric**: Consider how users will interact with the feature
- **Adversarial**: Try to break the code, not just confirm it works in ideal scenarios
- **Comprehensive**: Cover both happy paths and exceptional flows
- **Future-Proof**: Consider how tests will adapt to future changes
- **Maintainable**: Write tests that are clear, concise, and easy to maintain

## Test Quality Metrics

The quality of tests themselves will be measured against these criteria:

- **Reliability**: Tests should produce consistent results
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on or affect other tests
- **Speed**: Tests should execute quickly to facilitate rapid feedback
- **Clarity**: Tests should clearly express their intent and expected outcomes
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify

By adhering to these testing principles, the edv project will maintain high software quality while enabling rapid development and confident refactoring. 

## Implementation Status Update (2024)

As of March 2024, the edv project has made significant progress in implementing its testing philosophy:

### Current Testing Status

| Aspect | Status | Implementation Level | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Unit Testing | âœ… Complete | 85% | Core modules have extensive unit test coverage |
| Integration Testing | âœ… Complete | 75% | Key module interactions well-tested |
| System Testing | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 50% | Main workflows tested, expanding coverage |
| Performance Testing | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 40% | Basic benchmarks established, further metrics needed |
| Test Automation | âœ… Complete | 80% | CI pipeline fully operational for existing tests |

### Key Achievements

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Achieved >80% code coverage for completed modules
   - Implemented comprehensive tests for the FFmpeg wrapper component
   - Established robust testing for time utilities and string handling

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Successfully employed TDD for critical components like the Command Builder API
   - Used tests to guide API design for improved usability
   - Implemented comprehensive error case testing for robust error handling

3. **Automation**
   - Established CI pipeline running tests on all target platforms
   - Implemented automatic test runs on pull requests
   - Set up coverage reporting and trend tracking

### Focus Areas for Improvement

1. **Project Module Testing**
   - As the Project module is still under development (~40% complete), testing coverage needs to expand with implementation
   - Planning to implement more property-based tests for timeline operations
   - Working on test fixtures for complex project scenarios

2. **Asset Module Testing**
   - The Asset module (~30% complete) requires more comprehensive tests as implementation progresses
   - Developing mock implementations for testing metadata extraction
   - Creating test utilities for simulating various media files

3. **Performance Testing Expansion**
   - Need to establish more comprehensive performance baselines
   - Implementing more granular benchmarks for common operations
   - Developing performance regression detection in CI

### Upcoming Testing Initiatives

1. **Enhanced Test Data Management**
   - Creating a more structured approach to test fixture management
   - Implementing tools for generating synthetic test media
   - Building a repository of diverse test media files

2. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Introducing property testing for complex algorithms
   - Implementing fuzzing for robust input validation
   - Exploring model-based testing for state-heavy components

3. **Testing Documentation**
   - Expanding test documentation to improve maintainability
   - Creating testing guides for contributors
   - Documenting test patterns and best practices

The edv project remains committed to its testing philosophy, with ongoing efforts to maintain and improve the quality, reliability, and performance of the application through comprehensive testing.
