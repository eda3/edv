## Core Principles

1. **Core Functionality First**
   - Ensure basic video operations work reliably before adding advanced features
   - Establish a solid foundation for later development
   - Focus on common use cases before edge cases
   - Build essential infrastructure before optional features

2. **Stability over Features**
   - Prioritize stable operation over adding new features
   - Thoroughly test existing functionality before moving to new features
   - Fix bugs before implementing new capabilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility when adding features

3. **Performance Critical Paths**
   - Identify and optimize performance-critical code paths early
   - Focus on efficient handling of large video files
   - Prioritize memory efficiency for resource-constrained environments
   - Balance performance with code clarity and maintainability

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement features in a way that allows early testing and feedback
   - Release early and often to gather user input
   - Adapt implementation plans based on user experiences
   - Prioritize features based on user demand

## Feature Prioritization Methodology

Features will be prioritized using the following approach:

### Priority Levels

1. **Must Have (P0)**
   - Core functionality essential for basic operations
   - Features required for MVP release
   - Critical performance and stability requirements

2. **Should Have (P1)**
   - Important features for standard video editing workflows
   - Usability improvements for common operations
   - Performance optimizations for typical use cases

3. **Nice to Have (P2)**
   - Advanced features for specialized use cases
   - Additional convenience features
   - Further optimizations and refinements

4. **Future Consideration (P3)**
   - Features that may be implemented in later versions
   - Experimental or specialized capabilities
   - Optimizations for uncommon scenarios

### Prioritization Criteria

When determining the priority of features, the following factors will be considered:

- **User Impact**: How many users will benefit from the feature
- **Frequency of Use**: How often the feature will be used
- **Technical Foundation**: Whether the feature is a prerequisite for other features
- **Implementation Complexity**: The development effort required
- **Risk**: Potential impact on stability or performance

## Reprioritization Process

Priorities will be reviewed and potentially adjusted:

- At the completion of each development phase
- When significant user feedback is received
- If technical challenges or opportunities are discovered
- When external dependencies change

See [Risk Management](06_risk_management.md) for information on how project risks will be managed alongside these priorities.
