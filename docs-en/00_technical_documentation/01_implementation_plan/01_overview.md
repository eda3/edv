# edv - Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for `edv` - a CLI-based video editing tool written in Rust. The implementation will follow the specifications detailed in the design documents and will be carried out in phases to ensure steady progress and maintainable code.

## Key Goals

- Create an efficient CLI-based video editing tool
- Leverage FFmpeg's capabilities through a user-friendly interface
- Support script and pipeline integration
- Enable batch processing and automation
- Provide functionality in resource-limited environments

## Project Scope

The edv project encompasses:

1. A command-line interface for video editing operations
2. Core video processing capabilities using FFmpeg
3. Project management and timeline editing
4. Batch processing capabilities
5. Extensible architecture for future enhancements

## Target Users

- Command-line proficient developers and power users
- Users needing automated video processing pipelines
- Users with resource-constrained environments
- Users requiring batch processing of video files
