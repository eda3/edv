# Implementation Strategy

The edv project will follow these guiding principles to ensure successful implementation, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - All components will be developed as independent modules
   - Clear interface boundaries between modules
   - Dependency injection for better testing and maintenance
   - Plugin-like architecture for extensibility

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Test cases will be written before implementation of features
   - Comprehensive test coverage across all modules
   - Testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, system)
   - Automated testing integrated with development workflow

3. **Incremental Development**
   - Features will be developed in phases, starting with core functionality
   - Each phase delivers usable functionality
   - Regular releases with incremental improvements
   - Feedback incorporation between development phases

4. **Performance Focus**
   - Performance optimizations considered from the beginning
   - Careful memory management for large file processing
   - Efficient use of FFmpeg capabilities
   - Profiling and benchmarking as part of development cycle

5. **User Experience Priority**
   - Focus on user-friendly interface despite being CLI-based
   - Clear and helpful error messages
   - Consistent command syntax and behavior
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - Progress reporting for long-running operations

## Development Methodology

The project will use a modified Agile approach:

- Short development cycles (2-4 weeks)
- Regular review and adjustment of priorities
- Continuous integration and testing
- Documentation written alongside code
- Focus on delivering working functionality early

## Coding Standards

The project will adhere to idiomatic Rust practices:

- Follow Rust style guide and best practices
- Enforce code formatting with rustfmt
- Use clippy for static analysis
- Comprehensive documentation with rustdoc
- Error handling using the Result type system

## Development Tools

The project will use the following tools:

- Git for version control
- GitHub/GitLab for repository hosting and CI/CD
- Cargo for build management
- Rust analyzer for development assistance
- Automated testing frameworks

See [Development Phases Overview](03_phases_overview.md) for the phased implementation approach. 

## Implementation Progress Report

The implementation of the EDV project has been proceeding according to the guiding principles outlined in this document. Below is an assessment of how well each principle has been followed:

### 1. Modular Architecture

âœ… **Successfully Implemented**
- The project structure clearly demonstrates separation of concerns with distinct modules for different functionality
- The FFmpeg wrapper provides a clean interface for video processing operations
- Audio and subtitle modules are implemented as independent components
- The codebase shows good separation between the CLI interface and core processing logic

### 2. Test-Driven Development

ðŸ”„ **Partially Implemented**
- Unit tests have been written for critical components
- Testing of FFmpeg operations has been established
- More comprehensive test coverage is still needed, especially for edge cases
- Integration tests between modules are being developed

### 3. Incremental Development

âœ… **Successfully Implemented**
- Phase 1 has been completed with core functionality in place
- Phase 2 is approximately 70% complete, with usable audio and subtitle functionality
- Each implemented module provides standalone functionality
- Documentation is being updated to reflect current progress

### 4. Performance Focus

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- Basic performance considerations are evident in the implementation
- Memory management for large files is being addressed
- Intensive profiling and optimization is scheduled for Phase 4
- Current focus is on correctness and functionality, with targeted optimizations where needed

### 5. User Experience Priority

âœ… **Successfully Implemented**
- CLI interface follows consistent command patterns
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Progress reporting has been implemented for long-running operations
- Documentation provides examples of common usage patterns

### Development Tools Utilization

The tools outlined in the strategy have been effectively employed:
- Git for version control with proper branching strategy
- Cargo for build management
- Clippy and Rustfmt for code quality enforcement
- Documentation is being maintained with rustdoc

This progress report confirms that the implementation strategy is being followed successfully, with incremental improvements continuing as development progresses. See [Implementation Status](03_phases_overview.md#implementation-status-2024-update) for details on specific phase completion.
