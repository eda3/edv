## Risk Factors for Each Phase

| Phase | Key Risk Areas | Contingency Plan |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | FFmpeg compatibility across platforms | Build abstraction layer to handle differences |
| | Command parsing complexity | Simplify initial command set if needed |
| Phase 2 | Subtitle format complexity | Focus on most common formats first |
| | Timeline data structure design | Prototype different designs before full implementation |
| Phase 3 | Batch processing performance | Implement throttling and resource management |
| | Project file compatibility | Strong versioning and migration support |
| Phase 4 | GPU support variation | Clear feature detection and graceful fallback |
| | Plugin security | Strict sandboxing and validation |

This phased approach allows for incremental development with clearly defined deliverables at each stage, while maintaining the flexibility to adjust priorities based on feedback and challenges encountered during development.
