# edv - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for `edv` - a CLI-based video editing tool written in Rust. The implementation will follow the specifications detailed in the design documents and will be carried out in phases to ensure steady progress and maintainable code.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these guiding principles:

1. **Modular Architecture**: All components will be developed as independent modules for easier testing and maintenance
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Test cases will be written before implementation of features
3. **Incremental Development**: Features will be developed in phases, starting with core functionality
4. **Performance Focus**: Performance optimizations will be considered from the beginning
5. **User Experience Priority**: Despite being CLI-based, focus on user-friendly interface and clear feedback

## 3. Implementation Phases Overview

The project will be implemented in the following phases, aligned with the milestones defined in the design documents:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- Establish project structure and architecture
- Implement CLI framework with command parsing
- Develop FFmpeg wrapper for basic operations
- Implement core video operations (trim, cut, concat)
- Build basic configuration management

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality
- Implement audio processing functionality
- Add subtitle support
- Develop basic timeline editing features
- Enhance error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add advanced filters and effects
- Implement batch processing capabilities
- Develop project management functionality
- Enhance timeline editing with multi-track support

### Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- GPU acceleration support
- Plugin system design and implementation
- Quality assurance and comprehensive testing

## 4. Development Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 4-6 weeks | Project structure, CLI framework, Basic video operations |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 weeks | Audio processing, Subtitle support, Basic timeline |
| Phase 3 | 6-8 weeks | Advanced filters, Batch processing, Project management |
| Phase 4 | 4-6 weeks | Optimizations, GPU support, Plugin system |

Total estimated development time: 18-26 weeks

## 5. Implementation Priorities

The following priorities will guide the implementation process:

1. **Core Functionality First**: Ensure basic video operations work reliably before adding advanced features
2. **Stability over Features**: Prioritize stable operation over adding new features
3. **Performance Critical Paths**: Identify and optimize performance-critical code paths early
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Implement features in a way that allows early testing and feedback

## 6. Risk Management

Potential implementation risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| FFmpeg compatibility issues | High | Implement comprehensive tests with various FFmpeg versions |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Regular profiling and performance testing |
| Complex timeline implementation | High | Incremental approach with thorough design reviews |
| Cross-platform issues | Medium | Set up CI testing on all target platforms |
| Large file handling | Medium | Early testing with large files and streaming approaches |

## 7. Quality Assurance

Quality will be maintained through:

1. **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration and system tests for all components
2. **Code Reviews**: All code will undergo peer review before merging
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and tests for all commits
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish benchmarks for critical operations
5. **Static Analysis**: Use Rust's static analysis tools to ensure code quality

## 8. Next Steps

Immediate next steps to begin implementation:

1. Set up the project repository with proper CI/CD
2. Create the basic project structure as defined in the design 
3. Implement the core CLI framework and command parsing
4. Develop the FFmpeg wrapper with basic functionality
5. Implement the first basic video operation (trim)

This implementation plan will be reviewed and updated as development progresses.
