# Implementation Strategy

The edv project will follow these guiding principles to ensure successful implementation, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - All components will be developed as independent modules
   - Clear interface boundaries between modules
   - Dependency injection for better testing and maintenance
   - Plugin-like architecture for extensibility

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Test cases will be written before implementation of features
   - Comprehensive test coverage across all modules
   - Testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, system)
   - Automated testing integrated with development workflow

3. **Incremental Development**
   - Features will be developed in phases, starting with core functionality
   - Each phase delivers usable functionality
   - Regular releases with incremental improvements
   - Feedback incorporation between development phases

4. **Performance Focus**
   - Performance optimizations considered from the beginning
   - Careful memory management for large file processing
   - Efficient use of FFmpeg capabilities
   - Profiling and benchmarking as part of development cycle

5. **User Experience Priority**
   - Focus on user-friendly interface despite being CLI-based
   - Clear and helpful error messages
   - Consistent command syntax and behavior
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - Progress reporting for long-running operations

## Development Methodology

The project will use a modified Agile approach:

- Short development cycles (2-4 weeks)
- Regular review and adjustment of priorities
- Continuous integration and testing
- Documentation written alongside code
- Focus on delivering working functionality early

## Coding Standards

The project will adhere to idiomatic Rust practices:

- Follow Rust style guide and best practices
- Enforce code formatting with rustfmt
- Use clippy for static analysis
- Comprehensive documentation with rustdoc
- Error handling using the Result type system

## Development Tools

The project will use the following tools:

- Git for version control
- GitHub/GitLab for repository hosting and CI/CD
- Cargo for build management
- Rust analyzer for development assistance
- Automated testing frameworks
