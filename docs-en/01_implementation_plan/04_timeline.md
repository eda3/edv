# Development Timeline

This document outlines the estimated timeline for implementing the edv project across its four phases. The timeline provides a framework for planning and tracking progress, while allowing for adjustments based on development realities.

## Overall Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 4-6 weeks | Project structure, CLI framework, Basic video operations |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 weeks | Audio processing, Subtitle support, Basic timeline |
| Phase 3 | 6-8 weeks | Advanced filters, Batch processing, Project management |
| Phase 4 | 4-6 weeks | Optimizations, GPU support, Plugin system |

**Total estimated development time:** 18-26 weeks

## Detailed Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- **Week 1-2:** Project setup, CLI framework implementation
- **Week 3-4:** FFmpeg integration, configuration management
- **Week 5-6:** Core video operations, testing, documentation

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality
- **Week 7-8:** Audio processing implementation
