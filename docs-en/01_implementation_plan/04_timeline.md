# Development Timeline

This document outlines the estimated timeline for implementing the edv project across its four phases. The timeline provides a framework for planning and tracking progress, while allowing for adjustments based on development realities.

## Overall Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 4-6 weeks | Project structure, CLI framework, Basic video operations |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 weeks | Audio processing, Subtitle support, Basic timeline |
| Phase 3 | 6-8 weeks | Advanced filters, Batch processing, Project management |
| Phase 4 | 4-6 weeks | Optimizations, GPU support, Plugin system |

**Total estimated development time:** 18-26 weeks

## Detailed Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- **Week 1-2:** Project setup, CLI framework implementation
- **Week 3-4:** FFmpeg integration, configuration management
- **Week 5-6:** Core video operations, testing, documentation

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality
- **Week 7-8:** Audio processing implementation
- **Week 9-10:** Subtitle support development
- **Week 11-12:** Timeline data model and basic editing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Week 13-15:** Filters and effects implementation
- **Week 16-18:** Batch processing capabilities
- **Week 19-20:** Project management functionality

### Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancements
- **Week 21-22:** Performance optimization
- **Week 23-24:** GPU acceleration support
- **Week 25-26:** Plugin system, final testing, release preparation

## Milestones

1. **MVP Release (Week 6)**
   - First usable release with core functionality

2. **Beta Release (Week 12)**
   - Enhanced functionality with audio and subtitle support

3. **Feature-Complete Release (Week 20)**
   - All major features implemented

4. **1.0 Release (Week 26)**
   - Optimized, tested, and fully documented release

## Timeline Flexibility

The timeline includes buffer periods to account for:
- Technical challenges and unexpected issues
- User feedback incorporation
- Additional testing needs
- Documentation updates

Review points will be scheduled at the end of each phase to assess progress and adjust subsequent phases if necessary.

See [Implementation Priorities](05_priorities.md) for more information on prioritization during development.

## Timeline Update (2024)

The development timeline has been adjusted based on actual progress and implementation challenges. Key updates include:

### Progress Status

| Phase | Original Estimate | Current Status | Actual Duration |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | 4-6 weeks | âœ… Completed | 6 weeks |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 weeks | ðŸ”„ 75% Complete | 8 weeks (ongoing) |
| Phase 3 | 6-8 weeks | ðŸ”œ Not Started | - |
| Phase 4 | 4-6 weeks | ðŸ”œ Not Started | - |

### Phase 2 Milestone Updates

Phase 2 implementation has achieved several important milestones:

- âœ… **Week 7-8:** Audio processing completed with full support for volume adjustment, fading, extraction and replacement
- âœ… **Week 9-10:** Subtitle support completed with format handling, editing, and style management
- âœ… **Week 11-13:** Basic timeline data model implemented with track and clip management
- âœ… **Week 14-15:** Multi-track relationship model implemented with relationship types and dependency management
- âœ… **Week 16:** Track relationship serialization/deserialization completed

### Remaining Phase 2 Work

The following components are still in progress for Phase 2 completion:

- ðŸ”„ **Week 17-18:** Timeline advanced operations and validation (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ **Week 19:** Project state persistence optimization (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ **Week 20:** Documentation and test coverage enhancement

### Revised Timeline for Completion

The revised timeline for completing the remaining phases is:

- **Phase 2 Completion:** Expected in 4 weeks
- **Phase 3 Start:** Planned for Q3 2024
- **Phase 4 Start:** Planned for Q4 2024
- **1.0 Release:** Now projected for Q1 2025

This timeline adjustment reflects the additional time devoted to ensuring robust implementation of critical components, particularly the complex multi-track relationship management and serialization systems, which provide essential foundations for the remaining development.
