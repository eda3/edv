# Quality Assurance

This document outlines the quality assurance approach for the edv project. Quality will be built into the development process from the beginning to ensure a reliable, performant, and maintainable application.

## Quality Assurance Principles

Quality will be maintained through the following practices and approaches:

### 1. Automated Testing

Comprehensive testing will be implemented at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
  - Target >80% code coverage
  - Test each public function and method
  - Include edge cases and error conditions

- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
  - Verify correct component interaction
  - Test realistic usage scenarios
  - Include actual FFmpeg operations

- **System Tests**: Test the application as a whole
  - End-to-end tests for key workflows
  - Performance and stress testing
  - Cross-platform validation

- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no regressions
  - Run all tests on each commit
  - Maintain a test suite that grows with features
  - Include previously fixed bug scenarios

### 2. Code Reviews

All code will undergo peer review before merging:

- Ensure adherence to coding standards
- Validate design and implementation approaches
- Check for potential bugs or edge cases
- Verify documentation completeness
- Ensure test coverage

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

An automated CI/CD pipeline will be implemented:

- Run automated builds for each commit
- Execute the test suite on multiple platforms
- Perform static analysis checks
- Verify documentation generation
- Create development builds for testing

### 4. Performance Benchmarks

Performance will be actively monitored:

- Establish benchmarks for critical operations
- Track performance over time to detect regressions
- Test with various input sizes and formats
- Profile memory usage and CPU utilization

### 5. Static Analysis

Leverage Rust's static analysis tools:

- Run clippy to detect potential issues
- Enforce code formatting with rustfmt
- Check for unsafe code usage
- Verify error handling completeness
- Detect potential memory issues

## Quality Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked to assess quality:

- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds
- **Bug Density**: Number of bugs per thousand lines of code
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time for key operations
- **Static Analysis Warnings**: Number of warnings from static analysis

## Quality Assurance Process

The QA process will be integrated into the development workflow:

1. **Pre-Implementation**: Define test cases before implementation
2. **During Development**: Write tests alongside code
3. **Pre-Merge**: Run local tests and static analysis
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing in CI pipeline
5. **Release Validation**: Comprehensive testing before releases

## Documentation Quality

Documentation will be treated as a first-class artifact:

- Comprehensive API documentation
- Example-based user documentation
- Architecture and design documentation
- Regular review and updates

## User Experience Quality

Beyond code quality, user experience will be monitored:

- Command usability testing
- Clear and helpful error messages
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Intuitive command syntax and options

See [Next Steps](08_next_steps.md) for immediate actions to begin implementation with quality in mind. 

## Current Quality Assurance Status (2024)

As the project has progressed through Phase 1 and partially through Phase 2, quality assurance practices have been implemented with varying degrees of completeness. The following represents the current status of quality assurance efforts:

### Automated Testing Status

- **Unit Tests**: ~60% coverage of core functionality
  - FFmpeg wrapper has comprehensive tests
  - Audio processing functions have basic test coverage
  - Subtitle processing has targeted tests for critical functions
  - More comprehensive edge case testing needed

- **Integration Tests**: ~40% implemented
  - Basic workflow tests established
  - More cross-component tests needed
  - End-to-end tests for common scenarios in place

- **Regression Tests**: In development
  - Test suite runs on each commit
  - Previously identified bugs are tracked with corresponding tests
  - More automated regression test scenarios needed

### Code Quality Measures

- **Static Analysis**:
  - Clippy integration complete with custom configuration
  - Rustfmt enforced for consistent code style
  - Warning-free compilation enforced with allowances for specific cases
  - Regular audit of potential security issues

- **Code Review Process**:
  - Pull request review process established
  - Code review checklist implemented
  - Documentation review included in code review process

### Documentation Quality

- **API Documentation**: ~75% complete
  - Public APIs documented with examples
  - Function behaviors and error conditions documented
  - More comprehensive examples needed in some areas

- **User Documentation**: ~50% complete
  - Core functionality documented with examples
  - Command usage guides available
  - More tutorials and common workflow documentation needed

### Quality Metrics Tracking

The following metrics are currently being tracked:

| Metric | Current Status | Target | Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Test Coverage | ~60% | >80% | Focus on critical paths first |
| Build Success Rate | 98% | >99% | CI pipeline stability improving |
| Static Analysis Warnings | <10 | 0 | Working to address remaining warnings |
| Known Bugs | 12 | <5 | Prioritized by severity |
| Documentation Completeness | 65% | >90% | User-facing docs prioritized |

### Next Steps for Quality Improvement

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for edge cases in audio processing
   - Implement more integration tests between components
   - Add performance benchmarks for critical operations

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation for all public functions
   - Add more examples to user documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guide

3. **Improve Build Process**
   - Add more automated checks to CI pipeline
   - Implement performance regression testing
   - Add cross-platform testing

These quality assurance efforts will continue to be enhanced as development progresses through the remaining phases of implementation.
