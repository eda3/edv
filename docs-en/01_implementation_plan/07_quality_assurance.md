# Quality Assurance

This document outlines the quality assurance approach for the edv project. Quality will be built into the development process from the beginning to ensure a reliable, performant, and maintainable application.

## Quality Assurance Principles

Quality will be maintained through the following practices and approaches:

### 1. Automated Testing

Comprehensive testing will be implemented at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
  - Target >80% code coverage
  - Test each public function and method
  - Include edge cases and error conditions

- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
  - Verify correct component interaction
  - Test realistic usage scenarios
  - Include actual FFmpeg operations

- **System Tests**: Test the application as a whole
  - End-to-end tests for key workflows
  - Performance and stress testing
  - Cross-platform validation

- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no regressions
  - Run all tests on each commit
  - Maintain a test suite that grows with features
  - Include previously fixed bug scenarios

### 2. Code Reviews

All code will undergo peer review before merging:

- Ensure adherence to coding standards
- Validate design and implementation approaches
- Check for potential bugs or edge cases
- Verify documentation completeness
- Ensure test coverage

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

An automated CI/CD pipeline will be implemented:

- Run automated builds for each commit
- Execute the test suite on multiple platforms
- Perform static analysis checks
- Verify documentation generation
- Create development builds for testing

### 4. Performance Benchmarks

Performance will be actively monitored:

- Establish benchmarks for critical operations
- Track performance over time to detect regressions
- Test with various input sizes and formats
- Profile memory usage and CPU utilization

### 5. Static Analysis

Leverage Rust's static analysis tools:

- Run clippy to detect potential issues
- Enforce code formatting with rustfmt
- Check for unsafe code usage
- Verify error handling completeness
- Detect potential memory issues

## Quality Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked to assess quality:

- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds
- **Bug Density**: Number of bugs per thousand lines of code
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time for key operations
- **Static Analysis Warnings**: Number of warnings from static analysis

## Quality Assurance Process

The QA process will be integrated into the development workflow:

1. **Pre-Implementation**: Define test cases before implementation
2. **During Development**: Write tests alongside code
3. **Pre-Merge**: Run local tests and static analysis
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing in CI pipeline
5. **Release Validation**: Comprehensive testing before releases

## Documentation Quality

Documentation will be treated as a first-class artifact:

- Comprehensive API documentation
- Example-based user documentation
- Architecture and design documentation
- Regular review and updates

## User Experience Quality

Beyond code quality, user experience will be monitored:

- Command usability testing
- Clear and helpful error messages
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Intuitive command syntax and options
