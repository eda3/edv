# Implementation Phases Overview

The project will be implemented in the following phases, aligned with the milestones defined in the design documents. Each phase builds upon the previous one, delivering incremental functionality.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)

The first phase focuses on establishing the fundamental architecture and delivering basic video editing capabilities:

- Establish project structure and architecture
- Implement CLI framework with command parsing
- Develop FFmpeg wrapper for basic operations
- Implement core video operations (trim, cut, concat)
- Build basic configuration management

**Key Deliverables:**
- Functional CLI with help system
- Basic video trimming, cutting, and concatenation
- FFmpeg integration
- Configuration system
- Initial documentation

## Phase 2: Extended Functionality

The second phase extends the core functionality with additional media processing capabilities:

- Implement audio processing functionality
- Add subtitle support
- Develop basic timeline editing features
- Enhance error handling and logging

**Key Deliverables:**
- Audio extraction, adjustment, and replacement
- Subtitle loading, editing, and burning
- Basic timeline data model
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- User documentation expansion

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

The third phase adds more sophisticated features and enhances user productivity:

- Add advanced filters and effects
- Implement batch processing capabilities
- Develop project management functionality
- Enhance timeline editing with multi-track support

**Key Deliverables:**
- Color correction and visual effects
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Project file format and editing history
- Multi-track timeline editing
- Template system for common operations

## Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancements

The final phase focuses on performance, extensibility, and quality:

- Performance optimizations
- GPU acceleration support
- Plugin system design and implementation
- Quality assurance and comprehensive testing

**Key Deliverables:**
- Optimized processing pipeline
