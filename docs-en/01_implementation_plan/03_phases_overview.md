# Implementation Phases Overview

The project will be implemented in the following phases, aligned with the milestones defined in the design documents. Each phase builds upon the previous one, delivering incremental functionality.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)

The first phase focuses on establishing the fundamental architecture and delivering basic video editing capabilities:

- Establish project structure and architecture
- Implement CLI framework with command parsing
- Develop FFmpeg wrapper for basic operations
- Implement core video operations (trim, cut, concat)
- Build basic configuration management

**Key Deliverables:**
- Functional CLI with help system
- Basic video trimming, cutting, and concatenation
- FFmpeg integration
- Configuration system
- Initial documentation

## Phase 2: Extended Functionality

The second phase extends the core functionality with additional media processing capabilities:

- Implement audio processing functionality
- Add subtitle support
- Develop basic timeline editing features
- Enhance error handling and logging

**Key Deliverables:**
- Audio extraction, adjustment, and replacement
- Subtitle loading, editing, and burning
- Basic timeline data model
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- User documentation expansion

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

The third phase adds more sophisticated features and enhances user productivity:

- Add advanced filters and effects
- Implement batch processing capabilities
- Develop project management functionality
- Enhance timeline editing with multi-track support

**Key Deliverables:**
- Color correction and visual effects
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Project file format and editing history
- Multi-track timeline editing
- Template system for common operations

## Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancements

The final phase focuses on performance, extensibility, and quality:

- Performance optimizations
- GPU acceleration support
- Plugin system design and implementation
- Quality assurance and comprehensive testing

**Key Deliverables:**
- Optimized processing pipeline
- Hardware acceleration support
- Plugin API and example plugins
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarks

## Implementation Status (2024 Update)

As the project has progressed, the implementation of the planned phases has advanced significantly. Below is a summary of the current implementation status for each phase:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED

The foundation of the project has been successfully established:

- âœ… Project structure and architecture set up
- âœ… CLI framework implemented with command parsing (`src/cli/`)
- âœ… FFmpeg wrapper developed for basic operations (`src/ffmpeg/`)
- âœ… Core video operations framework established
- âœ… Basic configuration management implemented

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality - PARTIALLY COMPLETED (75%)

Significant progress has been made on extended functionality:

- âœ… Audio processing functionality implemented:
  - Volume adjustment (`src/audio/volume.rs`)
  - Audio fading (`src/audio/fade.rs`)
  - Audio extraction (`src/audio/extractor.rs`)
  - Audio replacement (`src/audio/replacer.rs`)
- âœ… Subtitle support added:
  - Subtitle model (`src/subtitle/model.rs`)
  - Subtitle editor (`src/subtitle/editor.rs`)
  - Format handling (`src/subtitle/format.rs`)
  - Style management (`src/subtitle/style.rs`)
  - Subtitle parser (`src/subtitle/parser.rs`)
- ðŸ”„ Timeline editing features:
  - âœ… Basic timeline data model implemented (`src/project/timeline/mod.rs`)
  - âœ… Multi-track relationship management (`src/project/timeline/multi_track.rs`)
  - âœ… Track relationship serialization/deserialization (`src/project/serialization/json.rs`)
  - ðŸ”„ Advanced timeline operations in progress
  - ðŸ”„ Project state persistence partially implemented
- âœ… Error handling and logging enhanced

### Phase 3 & 4: Future Work

Work on the advanced features (Phase 3) and optimizations (Phase 4) has not yet begun in earnest. These remain as future development targets after the completion of Phase 2.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on completing the remaining components of Phase 2:

1. Finalize advanced timeline features and operations
2. Complete project state persistence with optimized serialization
3. Implement comprehensive timeline validation
4. Enhance documentation for existing functionality
5. Improve test coverage for all components
