# Next Steps

This document outlines the immediate next steps to begin implementation of the edv project. These steps represent the initial actions needed to establish project foundations and start building the core functionality.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Set up the project repository with proper CI/CD**
   - Create Git repository
   - Configure GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
   - Set up build and test workflows
   - Establish branch protection rules
   - Configure code quality checks

2. **Create the basic project structure**
   - Initialize Cargo project
   - Set up the directory structure as defined in the design
   - Configure Rust edition and feature flags
   - Add initial dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Create module scaffolding

3. **Implement the core CLI framework**
   - Set up clap for command-line parsing
   - Create the main application entry point
   - Implement command registration system
   - Build help text generation
   - Add version and basic command infrastructure

4. **Develop the FFmpeg wrapper**
   - Create FFmpeg detection mechanism
   - Implement command builder API
   - Develop execution and monitoring
   - Build output parsing functionality
   - Add error handling for FFmpeg operations

5. **Implement the first basic video operation (trim)**
   - Develop input validation
   - Create FFmpeg command generation
   - Implement progress reporting
   - Add output validation
   - Create comprehensive tests

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create and initialize repository
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Add initial dependencies
- [ ] Create documentation framework
- [ ] Implement basic CLI structure
- [ ] Set up automated testing
- [ ] Create first feature implementation

## First Week Plan

### Day 1-2: Project Setup
- Repository creation
- CI/CD configuration
- Development environment setup
- Initial documentation

### Day 3-4: Core Infrastructure
- CLI framework implementation
- Basic application flow
- Configuration management foundations

### Day 5: FFmpeg Integration
- FFmpeg detection and validation
- Command execution infrastructure
- Initial wrapper implementation

## Initial Milestones

1. **Project Bootstrapped** (End of Day 2)
   - Repository is set up
   - CI/CD is operational
   - Project structure is established

2. **CLI Framework Complete** (End of Day 4)
   - Command-line parsing works
   - Command registry is functional
   - Help system is operational

3. **First Operation Implemented** (End of Week 2)
   - Trim operation is functional
   - FFmpeg integration works
   - Basic tests are passing

## Communication and Coordination

- Schedule kick-off meeting
- Establish regular check-in schedule
- Set up communication channels
- Define progress reporting format

This plan will be reviewed and updated as implementation begins and more information becomes available.
