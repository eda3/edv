# Implementation Priorities

This document outlines the priorities that will guide the edv implementation process. These priorities help ensure that development efforts are focused on the most important aspects of the project.

## Core Principles

1. **Core Functionality First**
   - Ensure basic video operations work reliably before adding advanced features
   - Establish a solid foundation for later development
   - Focus on common use cases before edge cases
   - Build essential infrastructure before optional features

2. **Stability over Features**
   - Prioritize stable operation over adding new features
   - Thoroughly test existing functionality before moving to new features
   - Fix bugs before implementing new capabilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility when adding features

3. **Performance Critical Paths**
   - Identify and optimize performance-critical code paths early
   - Focus on efficient handling of large video files
   - Prioritize memory efficiency for resource-constrained environments
   - Balance performance with code clarity and maintainability

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement features in a way that allows early testing and feedback
   - Release early and often to gather user input
   - Adapt implementation plans based on user experiences
   - Prioritize features based on user demand

## Feature Prioritization Methodology

Features will be prioritized using the following approach:

### Priority Levels

1. **Must Have (P0)**
   - Core functionality essential for basic operations
   - Features required for MVP release
   - Critical performance and stability requirements

2. **Should Have (P1)**
   - Important features for standard video editing workflows
   - Usability improvements for common operations
   - Performance optimizations for typical use cases

3. **Nice to Have (P2)**
   - Advanced features for specialized use cases
   - Additional convenience features
   - Further optimizations and refinements

4. **Future Consideration (P3)**
   - Features that may be implemented in later versions
   - Experimental or specialized capabilities
   - Optimizations for uncommon scenarios

### Prioritization Criteria

When determining the priority of features, the following factors will be considered:

- **User Impact**: How many users will benefit from the feature
- **Frequency of Use**: How often the feature will be used
- **Technical Foundation**: Whether the feature is a prerequisite for other features
- **Implementation Complexity**: The development effort required
- **Risk**: Potential impact on stability or performance

## Reprioritization Process

Priorities will be reviewed and potentially adjusted:

- At the completion of each development phase
- When significant user feedback is received
- If technical challenges or opportunities are discovered
- When external dependencies change

See [Risk Management](06_risk_management.md) for information on how project risks will be managed alongside these priorities.

## Implementation Priorities Update (2024)

As of the latest development milestone, the implementation priorities have been adjusted to reflect the current state of the project. With the successful implementation of the multi-track relationship serialization system, priorities have shifted toward completing the remaining timeline functionality.

### Current Priorities (Q2 2024)

1. **Advanced Timeline Operations (P0)**
   - Complete clip manipulation across multiple related tracks
   - Implement timeline event propagation between related tracks
   - Develop comprehensive track relationship validation

2. **Project Persistence Optimization (P0)**
   - Enhance serialization performance for large projects
   - Implement incremental save capabilities
   - Add robust error recovery during loading

3. **Timeline Rendering (P1)**
   - Develop efficient rendering pipeline for timeline preview
   - Implement track compositing for multi-track timelines
   - Add timeline navigation and zooming capabilities

4. **Edit History and Undo System (P1)**
   - Complete implementation of the edit history system
   - Implement reliable undo/redo across complex operations
   - Add support for operation grouping

5. **User Experience Improvements (P2)**
   - Enhance error messages and debug information
   - Implement progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Develop comprehensive documentation for timeline features

### Completed High-Priority Items

The following high-priority items have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Multi-track relationship data model
- ✅ Track relationship serialization and deserialization
- ✅ Timeline data structure fundamentals
- ✅ Audio processing core functionality
- ✅ Subtitle support and editing

These completed components provide a solid foundation for the remaining timeline functionality, which is now the primary focus of development efforts.
