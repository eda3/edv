# Implementation Priorities

This document outlines the priorities that will guide the edv implementation process. These priorities help ensure that development efforts are focused on the most important aspects of the project.

## Core Principles

1. **Core Functionality First**
   - Ensure basic video operations work reliably before adding advanced features
   - Establish a solid foundation for later development
   - Focus on common use cases before edge cases
   - Build essential infrastructure before optional features

2. **Stability over Features**
   - Prioritize stable operation over adding new features
   - Thoroughly test existing functionality before moving to new features
   - Fix bugs before implementing new capabilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility when adding features

3. **Performance Critical Paths**
   - Identify and optimize performance-critical code paths early
   - Focus on efficient handling of large video files
   - Prioritize memory efficiency for resource-constrained environments
   - Balance performance with code clarity and maintainability

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement features in a way that allows early testing and feedback
   - Release early and often to gather user input
   - Adapt implementation plans based on user experiences
   - Prioritize features based on user demand

## Feature Prioritization Methodology

Features will be prioritized using the following approach:

### Priority Levels

1. **Must Have (P0)**
   - Core functionality essential for basic operations
   - Features required for MVP release
   - Critical performance and stability requirements

2. **Should Have (P1)**
   - Important features for standard video editing workflows
   - Usability improvements for common operations
   - Performance optimizations for typical use cases

3. **Nice to Have (P2)**
   - Advanced features for specialized use cases
   - Additional convenience features
   - Further optimizations and refinements

4. **Future Consideration (P3)**
   - Features that may be implemented in later versions
   - Experimental or specialized capabilities
   - Optimizations for uncommon scenarios

### Prioritization Criteria

When determining the priority of features, the following factors will be considered:

- **User Impact**: How many users will benefit from the feature
- **Frequency of Use**: How often the feature will be used
- **Technical Foundation**: Whether the feature is a prerequisite for other features
- **Implementation Complexity**: The development effort required
- **Risk**: Potential impact on stability or performance

## Reprioritization Process

Priorities will be reviewed and potentially adjusted:

- At the completion of each development phase
- When significant user feedback is received
- If technical challenges or opportunities are discovered
- When external dependencies change

See [Risk Management](06_risk_management.md) for information on how project risks will be managed alongside these priorities.

## Implementation Priorities Update (2024)

As of the latest development milestone, the implementation priorities have been adjusted to reflect the current state of the project. With the successful implementation of the multi-track relationship serialization system and clip operation propagation, priorities have shifted toward completing the remaining timeline functionality.

### Current Priorities (Q2 2024)

1. **Timeline Rendering Enhancement (P0)**
   - Enhance the rendering pipeline with multi-track compositing
   - Optimize rendering performance for complex timelines
   - Implement efficient preview generation

2. **Undo/Redo System Finalization (P0)**
   - Complete testing and validation of the edit history system
   - Add support for complex operation grouping
   - Ensure reliable state restoration for all operations

3. **Timeline Validation (P1)**
   - Implement comprehensive relationship integrity checks
   - Add validation for clip operations across related tracks
   - Develop error recovery mechanisms for invalid states

4. **Documentation and Examples (P1)**
   - Create detailed documentation for timeline features
   - Develop example projects demonstrating multi-track editing
   - Add API usage examples for common operations

5. **User Experience Improvements (P2)**
   - Enhance progress reporting for rendering operations
   - Improve error messages for timeline validation
   - Add debugging tools for timeline state inspection

### Completed High-Priority Items

The following high-priority items have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Multi-track relationship data model
- ✅ Track relationship serialization and deserialization
- ✅ Timeline data structure fundamentals
- ✅ Audio processing core functionality
- ✅ Subtitle support and editing
- ✅ Basic clip operations (splitting, moving between tracks)
- ✅ Clip operation propagation across related tracks
- ✅ Selective project serialization for large projects
- ✅ Edit history recording mechanism

These completed components provide a solid foundation for the remaining timeline functionality, which is now the primary focus of development efforts.
