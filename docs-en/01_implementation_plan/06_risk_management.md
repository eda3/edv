|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| FFmpeg compatibility issues | High | Medium | Implement comprehensive tests with various FFmpeg versions |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Regular profiling and performance testing |
| Complex timeline implementation | High | High | Incremental approach with thorough design reviews |
| Cross-platform issues | Medium | Medium | Set up CI testing on all target platforms |
| Large file handling | Medium | Medium | Early testing with large files and streaming approaches |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

#### FFmpeg Compatibility Issues
- **Description**: Different FFmpeg versions may have incompatible interfaces or behaviors
- **Impact**: High - Could prevent basic functionality from working
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Create abstraction layer to handle version differences
  - Test with multiple FFmpeg versions
  - Document minimum version requirements
  - Create fallback mechanisms for missing features

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- **Description**: Operations may be too slow for practical use
- **Impact**: Medium - Could limit usability for large files
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement early performance testing
  - Profile critical operations
  - Optimize high-impact areas
  - Consider streaming processing for large files

#### Complex Timeline Implementation
- **Description**: Timeline editing has complex data structures and operations
- **Impact**: High - Could delay development or create bugs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple timeline model
  - Incrementally add features
  - Thorough unit testing
  - Consider proven design patterns from other editors

#### Cross-Platform Issues
- **Description**: Different OS behaviors may cause bugs
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect some users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use platform-agnostic APIs when possible
  - Test on all target platforms
  - Create platform-specific code paths when necessary
  - Leverage Rust's cross-platform capabilities

#### Large File Handling
- **Description**: Large video files may cause memory issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect specific use cases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement streaming processing
  - Test with large files early
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Create optimized paths for large files

### Project Risks

#### Schedule Slippage
- **Description**: Development may take longer than estimated
- **Impact**: Medium - Could delay releases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Include buffer in timeline
  - Prioritize features to ensure MVP completion
  - Regular progress monitoring
  - Adjust scope if necessary

#### Dependency Changes
- **Description**: External libraries may change APIs or behavior
- **Impact**: Medium - Could require code changes
- **Mitigation**:
  - Pin dependency versions
  - Abstract external interfaces
  - Monitor dependency updates
  - Test with new versions before upgrading

#### Resource Constraints
- **Description**: Limited development resources
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on core functionality first
  - Leverage existing libraries when possible
  - Design for maintainability
  - Prioritize ruthlessly

## Risk Monitoring

Risks will be monitored throughout the development process:

- Regular review of risk register
- Check for new risks at phase boundaries
- Track mitigation action effectiveness
- Adjust strategies as needed

## Contingency Plans

For high-impact risks, contingency plans will be prepared:

1. **Technical Workarounds**: Alternative approaches if primary solution fails
2. **Scope Adjustment**: Options for reducing scope while preserving core value
3. **Schedule Adjustment**: Realistic timeline adjustments if needed
4. **Resource Reallocation**: Moving resources to address critical issues

See [Quality Assurance](07_quality_assurance.md) for how testing will help identify and mitigate risks. 

## Risk Status Update (2024)

As development has progressed through Phase 1 and partially through Phase 2, the initial risk assessment has been revisited. This section provides an update on how the identified risks have been addressed and any new risks that have emerged.

### Technical Risk Updates

| Risk | Original Assessment | Current Status | Mitigation Effectiveness |
|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| FFmpeg compatibility issues | High impact, Medium likelihood | **Medium impact, Low likelihood** | Very Effective |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium impact, Medium likelihood | **Medium impact, Medium likelihood** | Partially Effective |
| Complex timeline implementation | High impact, High likelihood | **High impact, High likelihood** | Not Yet Implemented |
| Cross-platform issues | Medium impact, Medium likelihood | **Low impact, Low likelihood** | Effective |
| Large file handling | Medium impact, Medium likelihood | **Medium impact, Low likelihood** | Effective |

#### FFmpeg Compatibility
- **Updated Assessment**: Testing with multiple FFmpeg versions has proven effective
- **Current Status**: The abstraction layer has successfully handled version differences
- **Lessons Learned**: Early focus on version compatibility paid dividends

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- **Updated Assessment**: Some performance issues identified in audio processing
- **Current Status**: Targeted optimizations applied, more work needed in Phase 4
- **Lessons Learned**: Early profiling helps identify critical paths for optimization

#### Timeline Implementation
- **Updated Assessment**: Risk remains high as implementation is still pending
- **Current Status**: Preliminary design work started, technical challenges remain
- **Mitigation Plan**: Incremental approach with frequent design reviews planned

#### Cross-Platform Issues
- **Updated Assessment**: Risk lower than initially estimated
- **Current Status**: Rust's cross-platform capabilities minimized issues
- **Lessons Learned**: Platform-agnostic APIs have been very effective

#### Large File Handling
- **Updated Assessment**: Streaming approach has been effective
- **Current Status**: Successfully tested with files up to 4GB
- **Lessons Learned**: Memory usage monitoring important for optimization

### New Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| API stability during rapid development | High | Medium | Careful interface design, version management, deprecation warnings |
| Subtitle format compatibility | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing with various subtitle formats, robust error handling |
| Documentation keeping pace with development | Medium | High | Documentation-first approach, automated API doc generation |
| Growing technical debt | Medium | Medium | Regular refactoring sessions, code quality metrics, technical debt tracking |

### Project Risk Updates

The project risks have generally been well-managed:

- **Schedule Slippage**: Some slippage occurred but was managed through scope adjustment
- **Dependency Changes**: No major disruptions from external dependencies
- **Resource Constraints**: Focusing on core functionality has been effective

### Risk Management Effectiveness

The risk management approach has been largely effective:

- Regular risk reviews have helped maintain focus on potential issues
- Early identification of emerging risks has allowed proactive mitigation
- Technical strategy adjustments based on risk analysis have improved outcomes

The project will continue to monitor and update the risk assessment as development progresses through the remaining phases. The next comprehensive risk review is scheduled after the completion of Phase 2.
