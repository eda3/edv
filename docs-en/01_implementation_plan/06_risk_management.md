# Risk Management

This document outlines potential implementation risks for the edv project and strategies to mitigate them. Proactive risk management is essential for ensuring the project stays on track and delivers high-quality results.

## Key Risk Areas

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| FFmpeg compatibility issues | High | Medium | Implement comprehensive tests with various FFmpeg versions |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Regular profiling and performance testing |
| Complex timeline implementation | High | High | Incremental approach with thorough design reviews |
| Cross-platform issues | Medium | Medium | Set up CI testing on all target platforms |
| Large file handling | Medium | Medium | Early testing with large files and streaming approaches |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

#### FFmpeg Compatibility Issues
- **Description**: Different FFmpeg versions may have incompatible interfaces or behaviors
- **Impact**: High - Could prevent basic functionality from working
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Create abstraction layer to handle version differences
  - Test with multiple FFmpeg versions
  - Document minimum version requirements
  - Create fallback mechanisms for missing features

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- **Description**: Operations may be too slow for practical use
- **Impact**: Medium - Could limit usability for large files
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement early performance testing
  - Profile critical operations
  - Optimize high-impact areas
  - Consider streaming processing for large files

#### Complex Timeline Implementation
- **Description**: Timeline editing has complex data structures and operations
- **Impact**: High - Could delay development or create bugs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple timeline model
  - Incrementally add features
  - Thorough unit testing
  - Consider proven design patterns from other editors

#### Cross-Platform Issues
- **Description**: Different OS behaviors may cause bugs
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect some users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use platform-agnostic APIs when possible
  - Test on all target platforms
  - Create platform-specific code paths when necessary
  - Leverage Rust's cross-platform capabilities

#### Large File Handling
- **Description**: Large video files may cause memory issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect specific use cases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement streaming processing
  - Test with large files early
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Create optimized paths for large files

### Project Risks

#### Schedule Slippage
- **Description**: Development may take longer than estimated
- **Impact**: Medium - Could delay releases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Include buffer in timeline
  - Prioritize features to ensure MVP completion
  - Regular progress monitoring
  - Adjust scope if necessary

#### Dependency Changes
- **Description**: External libraries may change APIs or behavior
- **Impact**: Medium - Could require code changes
- **Mitigation**:
  - Pin dependency versions
  - Abstract external interfaces
  - Monitor dependency updates
  - Test with new versions before upgrading

#### Resource Constraints
- **Description**: Limited development resources
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on core functionality first
  - Leverage existing libraries when possible
  - Design for maintainability
  - Prioritize ruthlessly

## Risk Monitoring

Risks will be monitored throughout the development process:

- Regular review of risk register
- Check for new risks at phase boundaries
- Track mitigation action effectiveness
- Adjust strategies as needed

## Contingency Plans

For high-impact risks, contingency plans will be prepared:

1. **Technical Workarounds**: Alternative approaches if primary solution fails
2. **Scope Adjustment**: Options for reducing scope while preserving core value
3. **Schedule Adjustment**: Realistic timeline adjustments if needed
4. **Resource Reallocation**: Moving resources to address critical issues
