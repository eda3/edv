## Implementation Status Update (2024)

### Phase 3 Completion Status: NOT STARTED ⏳

Phase 3 development has not yet begun, as the team is currently focused on completing Phase 2 deliverables. Planning and preliminary design work for Phase 3 features are scheduled to begin once Phase 2 reaches completion.

#### Planning Status

1. **Advanced Filters and Effects**
   - ⏳ Initial research on FFmpeg filter capabilities completed
   - ⏳ Proof-of-concept implementations for key filters being explored
   - ⏳ Design documents for effect combination system in draft form

2. **Batch Processing**
   - ⏳ Requirements gathering in progress
   - ⏳ Initial job specification format being designed
   - ⏳ Research on parallel processing models underway

3. **Project Management**
   - ⏳ File format specifications in early draft
   - ⏳ Edit history design considerations being documented
   - ⏳ Template system requirements gathering initiated

4. **Multi-track Timeline**
   - ⏳ Dependent on Phase 2 timeline completion
   - ⏳ Extension points identified in current timeline implementation
   - ⏳ Research on composition algorithms in progress

#### Preliminary Work

Some exploratory work has been done to prepare for Phase 3:

- Research into FFmpeg filter graph capabilities for advanced effects
- Evaluation of parallel processing approaches for batch operations
- Investigation of serialization formats for project storage
- Review of synchronization challenges for multi-track editing

#### Dependencies and Prerequisites

Before Phase 3 can begin in earnest, the following prerequisites must be completed:

1. Full implementation of the timeline data model from Phase 2
2. Completion of project state persistence mechanisms
3. Stabilization of the core and extended functionality APIs
4. Comprehensive testing and documentation of Phase 2 deliverables

#### Projected Timeline

Once Phase 2 is completed (estimated at 4-6 weeks from now), Phase 3 development is expected to begin following the timeline outlined in this document. The team will revisit the Phase 3 plan at that time to incorporate lessons learned from Phase 2 and potentially adjust priorities based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
